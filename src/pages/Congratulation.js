                <strong>Life would be beautiful if we spend it together… </strong> I have thought about it several times, of how our life would be beautiful if we could spend it together forever. I have realized that you are truly the girl that is made for me, and I’m also the man that is made for you. We are both compatible with each other; every moment I have spent with you is the best moment of my life. I never imagined that an angel like you still exist in this world. I promise to be there for you every single moment of your life. I will be by your side. However, right now all that I’m asking you is a beautiful token of my heart.
